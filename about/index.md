My name is Vignesh (aka CaptMD-11) and Iâ€™m an aviation enthusiast. I am mostly into commercial aviation, and I am a fan of trijet airliners (primarily those produced by McDonnell Douglas). 

As many aviation geeks have their favorite aircraft manufacturer, mine has to be McDonnell Douglas. I have always liked their aircraft, since they all have an elegant touch to them. I especially admire the DC-10 and MD-11, since they are such iconic aircraft, and the shapes of their noses and cockpit windows are so aesthetic to the eye. 

The first aircraft I flew was a glider in Warner Springs, California, United States, in 2015. It was a very exciting experience, since I had the opportunity of piloting the plane during takeoff and the time spent in the air. It truly opened my eyes to how thrilling aviation can be! 

I also fly (virtually) in the X-Plane 11 flight simulator, and I am active on the X-Plane.org forums working on a project here and there. One of my latest projects include developing an MD-10-10 for X-Plane 11 with a team of collaborators. 

Carnatic music also interests me greatly. I can play the violin and mridangam, and have performed a few concerts, over the past few years.
