Western Global Airlines (White) for X-Plane 11 

On a plane spotting trip, I spotted some MD-11's, one of which was from Western Global Airlines. Inspired, I decided to make the livery of one of their aircraft with registration N513SN. 

Here is a screenshot during the work-in-progress:

Here are some screenshots of the final product:

And as usual, here is <a href="https://github.com/CaptMD-11/Western-Global-Airlines-White-Overland-MD-11.git" target="_blank">link<a/> to download the livery, in case you're interested :)
