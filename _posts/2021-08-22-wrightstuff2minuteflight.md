Broke the 2-Minute Mark! 

When I was a 7th grader, I joined the Science Olympiad at my school. Out of the many events offered, I chose Wright Stuff, since it dealt with aviation and it was hands-on. Our plane was made of balsa wood, plastic, and carbon fiber, and the way it received "power" was through the unwinding of a very long rubber band. 

Here's a video of one of our test flights that broke the 2-minute mark (a school record):
