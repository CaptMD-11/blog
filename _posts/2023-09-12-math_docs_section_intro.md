A fun project. 

Recently, I've been learning how to write $\rm\LaTeX$ documents. I write these documents mostly to analyze interesting math problems I see. I created a new section on the blog, titled "Math Docs," where I share my solutions to some of these problems. 

Currently, I have posted some solutions to integrals. Later, I plan to tackle math tournament problems. Feel free to check it out in case you're interested.
