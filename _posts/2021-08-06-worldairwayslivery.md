World Airways (White) MD-11 for X-Plane 11

One thing that had long been in my to-do list was to make a livery for the X-Plane 11 flight simulator. I procrastinated for months, and never actually took the initiative. So, a couple days ago, I decided to start with a relatively simple livery and see how it would go. 

I don't know if this is just me, but I always thought that the World Airways (white) livery looked so elegant on the MD-11. As far as I knew, no one had created this livery for the MD-11 in X-Plane, so I gave it a shot. 

It was around this point where I began to think about which software I would need to use to create the livery. I had heard of some programs like Photoshop, Affinity Designer, and others, but wasn't really willing to spend money. Then I looked at GIMP. I had used GIMP before to make a livery, but it just didn't turn out right. However, I wanted to give it another chance. Plus it was free!

So, now with all the resources at my disposal, I started making the livery using a blank paint kit posted by someone on the X-Plane forums. Since I was too lazy to look through any tutorials, I thought it might be a good idea to learn along the way. It wasn't as bad as I thought - to be honest. GIMP had pretty much every function I needed, so it worked well for me.

Sooner than later, the livery was completed. After constant examinations of how the livery rendered in the simulator, I decided to publish it on the X-Plane forums.

After making my first livery, I became inspired to make more liveries. I didn't realize how fun livery making can be! 

Here are some screenshots of the final product:
