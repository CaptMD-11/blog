An update on the statistics calculator... 

First of all, Merry Christmas! 

About a week ago, I finished writing the code for calculating the mode of a data set, which was the last statistic left in my list of one-variable computations. My next step was to create a website dedicated to the statistics calculator I'd been working on, which I named <i>VStats</i>. So, with the help of my friend Sean Boerhout, I set out to make the website from scratch, without the use of any ready-made website theme. In the first version, the <i>VStats</i> calculator will compute the following one-variable statistics of an integer data set: 

- mean
- range
- variance
- standard deviation
- number of values in the data set
- sum of values in the data set
- mode

and also the 5-number summary, which consists of:

- minimum
- first quartile
- second quartile (median)
- third quartile
- maximum

In the future, I plan to add other statistical calculations to the site, such two-variable statistics, binomial & geometric distributions, etc. In addition, code optimization is another area I would like to focus on, for the programs to run in an efficient manner. 

We'll see how things go :)
