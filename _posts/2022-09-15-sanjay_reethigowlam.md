A display of Sanjay Subrahmanyan's brilliance. 

Just wanted to share a recording Sanjay Subrahmanyan singing the <i>Reethigowla</i> krithi <i>Thathvamariyatharama</i> composed by Papanasam Sivan. The accompanying artists were Nagai Muralidharan on violin, Mannargudi Eashwaran on mridangam, G Guruprasanna on kanjira, and Tripunithura Radhakrishnan on ghatam. 

Here is the link to the recording:
