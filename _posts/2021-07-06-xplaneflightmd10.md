Screenshots of our latest project...

As you may have read in my About page, I am currently working on developing an MD-10-10 for the X-Plane 11 flight simulator, along with a few others. I thought I might share a few screenshots of the work-in-progress...

We have worked on modifying the landing gear, and some changes to the belly of the aircraft. Some things that have yet to be fixed include liveries, various cockpit issues, etc.
