A brilliant Shanmukhapriya. 

Recently, I have been listening a lot of concerts by the brilliant vocalist, Madurai TN Seshagopalan. I wanted to share a <i>Ragam-Thanam-Pallavi</i> in ragam <i>Shanmukhapriya</i> by him and his team (Nagai Sriram on violin, Guruvayur Dorai on mridangam, and S. Karthik on ghatam) that I was hearing. 

Here are the links to Part $1$ and Part $2$ of the RTP.
