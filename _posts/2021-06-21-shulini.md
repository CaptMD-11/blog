The highlight of the concert... 



This particular concert has always been very special to me, since I was a child. The singer, Sanjay Subrahmanyan, was accompanied by Nagai Muralidharan on the violin, K Arun Prakash on the mridangam, and Udupi Sridhar on the ghatam.

The concert was held on December 20, 2007, in Narada Gana Sabha Main Hall, Chennai, India. I literally grew up listening to this concert, alongside many others.

Although there were many well-executed pieces in this concert, I will discuss the <i>Shulini</i> main in this post, and leave the rest for another time. 

Allow me to narrate a small story. One time, when I was on a road trip in the year 2013, I was listening to this concert. We were listening to the main piece <i>Paramukhamadeno</i>, in ragam <i>Shulini</i>, and I could not recognize the ragam of the song, at that time. My parents hinted out the ragam during the <i>charanam</i>, where <i>Shulini</i> appeared in the lyrics, as many of Koteeswara Iyer's songs entail. It was then that I first heard of the ragam's name. After the road trip, I heard the song a couple more times, and I began to register the ragam's melody in my mind.

After a gap of about seven years, I began to hear the concert again, and when <i>Paramukhamadeno</i> came, I had a quick trip down memory lane, where I was able to recall the time when I learned that the ragam's name appeared in the <i>charanam</i> of the song. I then began to hear the concert numerous times, and practically became obsessed with it. The vibe from the concert began to resonate within me, and it instantly became one of my most favorite concerts. 



To wrap things up, I would say that this is one of the best concerts I have ever heard. It is available online, and I would definitely encourage anyone and everyone to listen to it.
