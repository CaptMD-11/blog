<p>An exciting diversion.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, my friend Ayush urged me to join him with his photography adventures. So, with my Nikon D$40$, I set out to take begin my nature photography excursions.</p>

<p>Just wanted to share some of the photos I took during our trips:</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/rocks_and_stream.png" width="700" alt="graph" style="border-radius:3%" />
<img src="assets/images/leaves.png" width="700" alt="graph" style="border-radius:3%" />
<img src="assets/images/rocks_and_still_water.png" width="700" alt="graph" style="border-radius:3%" />
<img src="assets/images/z2.png" width="700" alt="graph" style="border-radius:3%" />
<img src="assets/images/tree.png" width="700" alt="graph" style="border-radius:3%" />
<img src="assets/images/grass_plant_in_field.png" width="700" alt="graph" style="border-radius:3%" /></p>

<p>You can view all our photos <a href="https://photos.ayushnayak.me/" target="_blank">here<a></a>.</a></p>

<p>I hope to purchase some telephoto lens for aviation photography someday. Maybe that will open new doors :)</p>
