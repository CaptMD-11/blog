<p>An update on the statistics calculator…</p>

<p>First of all, Merry Christmas!</p>

<p>About a week ago, I finished writing the code for calculating the mode of a data set, which was the last statistic left in my list of one-variable computations. My next step was to create a website dedicated to the statistics calculator I’d been working on, which I named <i>VStats</i>. So, with the help of my friend Sean Boerhout, I set out to make the website from scratch, without the use of any ready-made website theme. In the first version, the <i>VStats</i> calculator will compute the following one-variable statistics of an integer data set:</p>

<ul>
  <li>mean</li>
  <li>range</li>
  <li>variance</li>
  <li>standard deviation</li>
  <li>number of values in the data set</li>
  <li>sum of values in the data set</li>
  <li>mode</li>
</ul>

<p>and also the 5-number summary, which consists of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>minimum</li>
  <li>first quartile</li>
  <li>second quartile (median)</li>
  <li>third quartile</li>
  <li>maximum</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future, I plan to add other statistical calculations to the site, such two-variable statistics, binomial &amp; geometric distributions, etc. In addition, code optimization is another area I would like to focus on, for the programs to run in an efficient manner.</p>

<p>We’ll see how things go :)</p>
