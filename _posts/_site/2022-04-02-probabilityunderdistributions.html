<p>Using integral calculus to calculate probabilities!</p>

<p>In my post about $z$-scores &amp; normal distributions, I briefly mentioned on how probabilities are computed using a normal distribution. In this post, I’d like to go a little more in-depth of how the calculation actually works, in addition to how this can be applied to other distributions as well.</p>

<p>Let’s first take the normal probability density function and write it in terms of $z$ ($z$-scores), for simplicity. We will assign the value of $\mu$ to $0$, and the value of $\sigma$ to $1$. Here is our function:</p>

\[f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}\]

<p>and in terms of $z$:</p>

\[f(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}}\]

<p>To calculate a probability, we can use calculus to integrate the normal probability density function between $2$ $z$-scores. For instance, let’s assume that we select the $z$-interval from $z=-0.5$ to $z=0.5$. Here is the definite integral that we need to compute in order to find $P(-0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.5)$:</p>

\[P(-0.5 &lt; z &lt; 0.5) = \int_{-0.5}^{0.5} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}} \space dz\]

<p>The answer to this integral comes out to be about $0.38292$, which represents the probability that $z$ is between $-0.5$ and $0.5$.</p>

<p>Suppose we wanted to know the probability that $z$ is between the region from $0.5$ to $+\infty$. This would be represented by the following improper integral:</p>

\[P(z &gt; 0.5) = \int_{0.5}^{+\infty} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{z^2}{2}} \space dz\]

<p>And the answer comes out to be about $0.30854$, which is the result of integrating the normal probability density function between the two “bounds.”</p>

<p>What if we wanted to find a probability under, say, the $\chi^2$ distribution? We would first need to define our bounds for the integral. However, we would need to be careful with our low bound, since the minimum $\chi^2$ value for the distribution is $0$. Next, we would use the same integral calculation to calculate our probability. For this example, let’s assume our degrees of freedom is equal to $4$ (for a Goodness of Fit statistical test), and our low &amp; high bounds are $7.3$ and $+\infty$, respectively. Let $k$ represent the degrees of freedom, and $\Gamma$ represent the gamma function. Here is our integral:</p>

\[P(\chi^2 &gt; 7.3) = \int_{7.3}^{+\infty} \frac{\left(\chi^2\right)^{\frac{k}{2}-1}\cdot{e^{-\frac{\chi^2}{2}}}}{2^{\frac{k}{2}}\cdot\Gamma\left(\frac{k}{2}\right)} \space d\chi^2\]

<p>And, our answer turns out to be about $0.12086$.</p>

<p>It’s amazing that the probabilities under distributions in statistics are computed using important calculus concepts like integration. Differential calculus (as far as I know) seems to be quite rare in statistics, but we shall see what the future unfolds!</p>
