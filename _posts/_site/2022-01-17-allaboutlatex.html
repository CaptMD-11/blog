<p>Why I use $\rm\LaTeX$!</p>

<p>If you’ve seen some of my previous posts about different concepts in statistics, I provide mathematical formulas to illustrate certain ideas. I use a software called $\rm\LaTeX$, which allows me to accomplish this by writing some basic code.</p>

<p>I actually use <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/texer" target="_blank">this</a> neat online $\rm\LaTeX$ editor, which allows me to directly copy over the output formula to my computer.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose I wanted to write the probability density function, as shown here:</p>

<p>All I have to do is write the code that will generate the formula, and I’m done! Here is the code itself:</p>

<pre>\begin{displaymath}
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}
\end{displaymath}</pre>

<p>$\rm\LaTeX$ can also be used to write formal research papers and even textbooks.</p>

<p>The syntax for the $\rm\LaTeX$ language is very simple &amp; intuitive, which makes it very easy for people to learn. Thus, I would highly recommend this software, even if you are new to writing code. Here is the download <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/" target="_blank">link</a> to install on your computer if you’re interested.</p>
