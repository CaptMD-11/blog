<p>A long-term project.</p>

<p>Although it’s been a while since my previous post on the MD-$10$-$10$ project, I am glad to announce that this aircraft has been released. Some of the features include a $3$D cockpit, landing gear modifications, a paint kit, and much more.</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots:</p>
