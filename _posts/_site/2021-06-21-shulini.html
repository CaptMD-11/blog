<p>The highlight of the concert…</p>

<p>This particular concert has always been very special to me, since I was a child.</p>

<p>The concert was held on December 20, 2007, in Narada Gana Sabha Main Hall, Chennai, India. I literally grew up listening to this concert recording, alongside many others.</p>

<p>Although there are many well-executed pieces in this concert, I will discuss the main piece in this concert, in ragam <i>Shulini</i>.</p>

<p>Allow me to narrate a small instance. One time, when I was on a road trip back in 2013, I was listening to this concert. We were listening to the main piece <i>Paramukhamadeno</i>, in ragam <i>Shulini</i>, and I could not recognize the ragam of the song, at that time. My parents indicated the presence of the ragam’s name in the <i>charanam</i>, as many of Koteeswara Iyer’s songs entail. It was then that I first heard of the ragam’s name. After the road trip, I heard the song a couple more times, and I began to register the ragam’s melody in my mind.</p>

<p>After a gap of several years, I began to hear the concert again, and when <i>Paramukhamadeno</i> came, I had a quick trip down memory lane, where I was able to recall the time when I learnt that the ragam’s name appeared in the <i>charanam</i> of the song. I then began to hear the concert numerous times, and practically became obsessed with it. The vibe from the concert began to resonate within me, and it instantly became one of my most favorite concerts.</p>

<p>To wrap things up, I would say that this was one of the best concerts I have ever heard. It is available online, and I would definitely encourage anyone and everyone to listen to it.</p>
