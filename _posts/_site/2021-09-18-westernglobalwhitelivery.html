<p>Western Global Airlines (White) for X-Plane 11</p>

<p>On a plane spotting trip, I spotted some MD-11’s, one of which was from Western Global Airlines. Inspired, I decided to make the livery of one of their aircraft with registration N513SN.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot during the work-in-progress:</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots of the final product:</p>
