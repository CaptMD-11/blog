Although trijets have disappeared from the passenger market, they still have a strong presence in the cargo world. Let's take a look at why... 

One reason why trijets prove to be extremely good freighters is the very fact that they have three engines. The presence of three engines gives the power in order to haul more freight, where space is not always the dealbreaker for capacity.

Another factor that must be considered is the cargo capacity that trijets have. When compared to something like the Boeing 777, trijets closely match the capacity that the 777 offers. Letâ€™s take the McDonnell Douglas MD-11, for example. It has about 90% of the volume of the 777F. So, due to their large capacities, trijets prove to be attractive options for cargo operators.

Furthermore, trijets have relatively low purchase prices, since they are all acquired through the secondary market. Even though trijets are less efficient than twinjets, cargo airlines are still open to using trijets, since they are cheaper to obtain.

So, with respect to the total engine power, cargo capacity, and low purchase price, here are three reasons why trijets are excellent freighters.
