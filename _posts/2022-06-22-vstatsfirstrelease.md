The product of months of work. 

I am happy to announce the initial release of the VStats Java statistics library! I originally anticipated the library to only contain computations for one-variable statistics. However, the project has grown to support linear regression, confidence intervals, significance tests, and other statistical functions. 

You can now download the VStats library <a href="https://captmd-11.github.io/blog/statscalculator/" target="_blank">here</a>. I plan on creating a GitHub Discussions page for the repository so that users can discuss any issues or concerns with the library. 

Have fun with your statistical adventures!
