Capturing the scenes during a trip. 

Yesterday, my friend Ayush and I went on a bike ride to take some more photos. We're into nature photography, so we decided to bike along a scenic route and capture anything we thought was interesting. I'd like to share $2$ photos that I took during our trip:

This story behind this next photo is pretty interesting. So we were at a pond and I thought of taking a reflection shot aiming at the water, with a tree as the subject. The tree would be in the frame, since the angle between the tree and the water was equal to the angle between me and water. When I tried to take the shot, the tree was upside down in the frame as expected. Ayush tried this as well, except he held the camera upside down and took the shot, thus making the tree in an "upright" position in the photo. I utilized his technique and took the picture below.

At first glance, it doesn't even seem like this is a reflection picture, but as you examine closely, there are faint water ripple marks that give away the technique!
