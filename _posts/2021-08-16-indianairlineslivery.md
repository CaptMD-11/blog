Independence Day Special!

After completing my first livery, I became encouraged to make more, as it was a very fun experience and I had learnt how to use GIMP. I was thinking about what livery might look nice on the MD-11 when I thought of Indian Airlines. I've always loved the paint scheme of their livery - simple but beautiful. Their logo also caught my eye as well. 

During the course of the project, I learnt several new skills in GIMP. For instance, I figured out how to use the paint brush tool correctly. This gave the tail of the aircraft a "shiny" look, since every pixel was covered with the characteristic red color. 

Also, this was the first time that I did a little nose work. It was a challenge to get the the black paint to be perfectly symmetrical, with respect to the nose section of the aircraft. 

Here are some screenshots during the development phase:

After a lot of work, the project reached its finished state. Here are some screenshots of the final product:

Since I was making an Indian Airlines livery, I thought it might have been appropriate to release it on the diamond jubilee of Indian Independence. If you'd like, here is a <a href="https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/74269-indian-airlines-livery-pack-for-md-11-celebrating-75-years-of-indian-independence/">link</a> to the download page of the livery. I have included two versions, one with the black nose and one without.
