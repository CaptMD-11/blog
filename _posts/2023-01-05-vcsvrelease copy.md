A complementary addition to VStats. 

Several months ago, I wrote a post about VCSV, a program that would allow users to analyze data contained inside CSV files using VStats functions. The only issue was that a large portion of VStats functions require arrays as inputs. So, I wrote VCSV, a Java library that would help with parsing the raw data into an array format. 

You can now download the VCSV library <a href="https://captmd-11.github.io/blog/vcsv/" target="_blank">here</a>! 

Have fun with your statistical adventures!
