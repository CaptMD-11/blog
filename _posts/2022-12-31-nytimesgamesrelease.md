A culmination of an exciting journey. 

In my previous post, I introduced my latest project of attempting to write some programs that would help solve the Letter Boxed and Spelling Bee <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords" target="_blank">puzzles</a> on the NY Times Games website. Well, you can now download these programs (in the form of JAR libraries) <a href="https://captmd-11.github.io/blog/nytimesgames/" target="_blank">here</a>! 

I would highly recommend checking out the  <a href="https://github.com/CaptMD-11/NYTimesGames#nytimesgames" target="_blank"><samp>README</samp></a> for more information. 

Have fun using these libraries and I wish everyone a happy $2023$!
