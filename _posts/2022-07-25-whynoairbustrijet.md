My thoughts on why Airbus evaded the trijet market. 

Today, Airbus is one of the most dominant aircraft manufacturers in the commercial aviation sector. They have produced a wide range of aircraft, from short-haul narrow-body aircraft to the largest passenger airliner ever made. However, Airbus never built a three-engined airliner. Why? 

From the beginning, Airbus has tried to outperform the competition. For instance, the A$300$ (their first aircraft) was designed to compete with the American trijets, specifically the DC-$10$ and L-$1011$ TriStar. So, it wouldn't look good for Airbus if they developed a trijet later on.

Also, creating a new aircraft that would fit three engines might not have been feasible. The A$300$ was well-designed, and Airbus instead chose to slightly improve its design in subsequent aircraft models, such as the A$330$ family. 

Now, let's fast-forward to the A$340$, Airbus' first four-engined airliner aimed toward the ultra-long-haul market. It was only able to achieve its range through the addition of fuel tanks. So, it makes sense that Airbus decided to go with four engines - to provide the power necessary to carry the additional weight of the fuel.

At the end of the day, Airbus' absence in the trijet market has worked out well for them. Airbus has never been much of a cargo aircraft manufacturer, so it's probably better for them to develop more efficient two-engined airliners.
