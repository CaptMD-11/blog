United Parcel Service (Retro) for X-Plane 11 

Looking at the liveries I've done, I realized I did not make a retro livery. I found it quite hard to find pictures of the UPS retro, so I decided to make it as one of my projects. After about 20+ hours of image editing and browsing JetPhotos.com, I present a UPS retro livery for the MD-11, with registration N252UP. 

Here are some screenshots during the work-in-progress:

<br>

Here are some screenshots of the final product:
